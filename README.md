# nba-box-score-predictions

We are looking to build the perfect basketball player. To me, that's Lebron athleticism, Stephâ€™s shooting, Magic Johnson Passing, and Kawhi Leonard defense. Build your perfect player from the last 12 years of players and produce 20 games stat lines (Just PTS, AST, and TRB will do but feel free to add more). Provide visualization to support how this player performed in the 20 games. Again feel free to be creative with your approach. 

Use the .csv with the last 12 years of games for every player in the NBA.
